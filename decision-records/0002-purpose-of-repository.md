# Purpose of the Repository

Date: 2025-07-23

## Status

Accepted

## Context and Problem Statement

This repository serves as the central location for managing decision records and shared resources for the 5G Emerge Phase 2 WP 2.3.1.

A clear purpose statement ensures all contributors understand the scope and intent of the repository.

## Considered Options

- Do not define a clear purpose
- Define the purpose in the README only
- Record the repository purpose as a decision record

## Decision Outcome

We will record the purpose of this repository as a decision record. This ensures the purpose is versioned, discoverable, and maintained alongside other key decisions.

The README can be used as an introduction to the repository and contain wider details and how to make use of the resources available.

The repository will contain:

- Decision Records following the MADR format
- Tools and scripts for managing the repository, its resources, and the wider project
- Shared resources such as configuration files, sample dashboards and IP whitelists

## Consequences

- The repository's scope and intent are clearly documented and easily referenced
- Contributors have a single source of truth for architectural decisions, configuration, and examples
- Future changes to the repository's purpose can be tracked and discussed as part of the ADR process
